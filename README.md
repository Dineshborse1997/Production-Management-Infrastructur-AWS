# 🚀 Production Management Infrastructure on AWS

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a **fault-tolerant, scalable, and secure AWS infrastructure** using core AWS services including **VPC, EC2, Auto Scaling, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and NAT Gateway**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Services Used

- **Amazon VPC**
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
- **Auto Scaling Groups**
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **NAT Gateway**
- **Subnets (Public & Private)**
- **Route Tables & Internet Gateway**
- **Security Groups**

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Resources are distributed across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
- **Custom VPC** with well-structured public and private subnets.
- **Public Subnets** host the ALB and NAT Gateway.
- **Private Subnets** host EC2 instances running backend applications.
- **NAT Gateway** ensures secure outbound internet access for private EC2 instances.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** distributes incoming traffic to EC2 instances based on health checks and target group configurations.
- **Auto Scaling Groups** manage EC2 instances based on demand, ensuring cost-efficiency and performance.

## 🌐 Key Features

✅ **Highly Available**: Fault-tolerant infrastructure across multiple Availability Zones  
✅ **Scalable**: Auto Scaling handles increasing/decreasing load dynamically  
✅ **Secure**: Private EC2 instances shielded from direct internet access  
✅ **Optimized Traffic Handling**: ALB ensures intelligent routing and health-based traffic distribution  
✅ **Disaster Recovery Ready**: 99.99% uptime ensured through redundancy and failover

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Improve application **uptime** and **resilience**
- **Reduce manual scaling** using automation
- Ensure **network segmentation** and **security** best practices
- Enable **secure outbound communication** from private resources

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- Add CloudWatch Alarms and dashboards for real-time monitoring  
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI  
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform or AWS CloudFormation  
- Enable WAF and Shield for enhanced security
